Repository for 4YP 'control for smart transportation' code

Veins_scenarios contains code that is used in Veins - a combination of traffic scenario simulation and inter-vehicular communication. 

custom_SUMO_scenarios contains code that is used in SUMO - written to explore what SUMO has to offer in the context of the project.

As the project is progressing, it is becoming more clear that the Veins source code is where work needs to be focussed. I will include the edited files in the source code here when necessary, with the two main file locations being:

veins/src/veins/modules/application/traci/TraCIDemo11p.cc
veins/src/veins/modules/mobility/traci/TraCImobility.cc

Code for Veins can be found at veins.car2x.org
